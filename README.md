## üõ† Features
- Hides the rootkit module from `/proc/modules`.
- Runs a simulated crypto-mining daemon (no real cryptocurrency mining).
- Hides the running crypto-mining process by name.

---

## üìö Requirements
- Linux (specific Ubuntu version specified in Deliverables)
- `make` and `gcc`

---

## üöÄ Usage
```bash
# Build the kernel module
make

# Load the module
sudo insmod rootkit.ko

# Remove the module
sudo reboot

# NOTE:
sudo rmmod rootkit.ko will NOT work. An entire reboot of the system is required to remove the rootkit. This is because the rootkit kernel module is hidden, so as far as the system is concerned, rootkit.ko does not even exist.
